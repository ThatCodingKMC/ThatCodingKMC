## About Me

I'm a computer science student at UCF about to graduate summer 2025 with my BS and a minor in business. After graduation I hope to work while also studying for a masters in computer engineering. I focus my studies on embedded software and cybersecurity. I've also worked/studied web development and mapping softwares. For fun I contribute to projects like pwn.college or create cyber ctf challenges for competitions.
